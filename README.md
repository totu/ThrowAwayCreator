**NOTE** Mailinator has changed their API access to be ***PAID ONLY**, as of 9.7.2016 paid access costs $29/mo. So I guess this means I'll have to start looking for new mailbox provider because this price is way too steep for the service. 

## How to use?
1. Get API key from [Mailinator](https://mailinator.com/) (costs $29/mo)
2. Plug your shiny new API key into the script
3. Run the script
4. Push "New ID" to get a new ID
5. (OPTIONAL) If the place you need throwaway for requires email confirmation click "Get Mail" to see latest mail in the random mailinator box
6. Try not to be evil
